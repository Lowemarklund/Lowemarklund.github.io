Hi, my name is Lowe Marklund, I'm a 26 year old guy living in Helsingborg, Sweden. I have lived here since 2015 but I'm originally from a town called Boden up in the far north of Sweden. I'm a big music nerd so that is what I spend most of my free time pursuing. Playing guitar, writing songs, rehearsing etc. I play in a band called Twin Pyramid Complex,<a href="https://twinpyramidcomplex.bandcamp.com/album/jinx-equilibria" target="_blank"> listen our debut album we released earlier this summer!</a> When I'm not working on music I like to make art in photoshop. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lowe_marklund/" target="_blank"> Check out my instagram!</a> 

My journey with programming started back in 2010 when I started to study computer engineering at the Luleå University of Technology, I quit 6 months in due to lack of interest and a willing to focus more on my music. I studied art one year at Sunderby Folkhögskola and then worked delivering newspapers for a couple of years, until I had enough money to move down to Helsingborg where I then started to work as a taxi driver. After a year of driving cabs a got fed up and finally found my way back to studying and programming, which is why I'm now studying at the Linnæus University!
