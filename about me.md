Hi, my name is Lowe Marklund, I'm a 26 year old guy living in Helsingborg, Sweden. I have lived here since 2015 but I'm originally from a town called Boden up in the far north of Sweden. I'm a big music nerd so that is what I spend most of my free time pursuing. Playing guitar, writing songs, rehearsing etc. Check out my bands music on our band camp if you feel like it! We are called Twin Pyramid Complex,<a href="https://twinpyramidcomplex.bandcamp.com/album/jinx-equilibria"> here's a link to our bandcamp page.</a>

My journey with programming started back in 2010 when I started to study computer engineering at the Luleå University of Technology, I quit 6 months in due to lack of interest and a willing to focus more on my music. I studied art one year at Sunderby Folkhögskola and then worked delivering newspapers for a couple of years, until I had enough money to move down to Helsingborg where I then started to work as a taxi driver. After a year of driving cabs a got fed up and finally found my way back to studying and programming, which is why I'm now studying at the Linæus University!
